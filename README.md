 Playing around with Anki revision log data

# How I created the data set "revlog.csv" which includes a log on all my Anki revisions:

* Download and install SQLite [here](https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/)

* Find "collection.anki2" (your current version of your Anki stats) on your machine and copy it

* Open it in SQLite, right click on the file name and save the "revlog" as .csv
